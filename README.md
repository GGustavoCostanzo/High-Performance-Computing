# High Performance Computing

Exercise 1
1.1 Introduction
The exercise is focused on the implementation of a parallel version of Conway’s
“Game of Life”. 

Exercise 2
2.1 Introduction
The goal of the second exercise was to evaluate the performance of the
math libraries MKL (Intel Math Kernel Library), OpenBLAS (an open-
source BLAS library) and BLIS (BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software
Framework) when performing matrix-matrix multiplication, and to com-
pare it with the Theoretical Peak Performance.
The matrix multiplication was carried on with the use of the gemm func-
tion - a level 3 BLAS function - which is available both for single and
double precision
